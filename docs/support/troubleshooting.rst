Loading or authentication issues
--------------------------------

When loading Streetmix, the screen is stuck on the loading spinner indefinitely, or I only see the "Weâ€™re having trouble loading Streetmix. (Error RM1)" error message.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If Streetmix is stuck on the initial loading spinner screen, try to open a "private mode" window in your browser. Normally, this mode is used to prevent browsers from saving history, and it also means you can start with a "clean slate" when browsing the web. Here are resources for the two most common browsers.

- `How to browse in Incognito mode in Chrome <https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95464>`_
- `How to enter Private Browsing in Firefox <https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/private-browsing-use-firefox-without-history>`_

If Streetmix works in private mode, this means something in your browser cache has become corrupted. You will want to reset your browser back to a "clean slate." 

- `How to clear browsing data in Chrome <https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2392709>`_
- `How to clear cookies and site data in Firefox <https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/clear-cookies-and-site-data-firefox#w_clear-cookies-for-the-current-website>`_

If Streetmix does not work in private mode, or still does not work after clearing your browser's cache, please ensure that you are using the latest version of Chrome or Firefox. If you still need help, please :ref:`contact us <contact>`.


When following an e-mail sign-in link, I see the "You cancelled the sign-in process" message.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This can happen when an organization-managed e-mail service blocks or tampers with the sign-in link while doing routine security checks. We are currently investigating solutions to this problem but do not yet have a timeline for a fix. The following workarounds can help:

- Sign in with a personal e-mail address (e.g. Gmail) or with a Twitter, Facebook or Google account method.
- Ask your organization's IT administrators to allow sign-in emails from Streetmix.

Development issues
------------------

While developing Streetmix, here are solutions to some problems that may arise.


Strategies for resolving most common issues
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Check which version of Node.js you are using and make sure it matches the versions listed in ``package.json``.

If you're still running into problems, **try this first!**:

- Update your global ``node`` and ``npm`` versions to the latest versions.
- Remove the :file:`node_modules` and :file:`.cache` folders, if present, and reinstall (:ref:`install-streetmix`).
- Ensure that you are installing and running Streetmix with ``npm``, not ``yarn``.


Specific issues
+++++++++++++++

This section is for troubleshooting specific issues.

- **The server keeps restarting in a loop** with the ``EADDRINUSE`` error code. We have documented a solution in `GitHub issue #983 <https://github.com/streetmix/streetmix/issues/983>`_.
