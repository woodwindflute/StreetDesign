Frontend Tests
===============

The frontend tests are in the ``__tests__`` folder of each directory.  
The naming convention is ``filename.test.js``.

Unit tests
---------------------

We use the `Jest testing framework <https://jestjs.io/en/>`_.

End-to-end testing
---------------------

We have adopted `Cypress.io <https://www.cypress.io/>`_, a modern framework for end-to-end testing, to make writing and running our integration and end-to-end tests easier.
